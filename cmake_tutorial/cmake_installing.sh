#C/C++ does not have a package manager like pip in python, but we still have a way to setup and "make" the libraries/code written by others work together with our own project using this.. maybe

# it also allows our project to become portable... how ? will see 

# on linux : sudo apt-cache policy cmake
# this checks what ver our ubuntu package manager has of cmake

# install :sudo apt install cmake
