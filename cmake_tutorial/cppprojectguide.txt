how to structure a c++ project?

header files	// go into "include" directory
source file	//go into "source" directory
executables	// they are normally examples for/of the libraries that you are developing, then they go into the "examples" directory

there must be a topmost/parent directory where the CMakeLists file stays for the whole project, and there may be others of these files that exist in the libs included etc
